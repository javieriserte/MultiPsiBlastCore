Features To be added:
1 - Filter for each group of results (i.e. results obtained with the a protein of a genome with several evalues cutoff).
    Keep one of the identical groups. - Done
2 - Look for unique proteins in each genome. - Done
3 - Verify that groups of results starting a different genomes are found in other genomes.
4 - Create a BaculoFilter class and keep results that found proteins shared between 50 to 58 genomes. - Almost Done
5 - Look for homogeneity of groups. Search the common proteins and the total number of proteins found. May create a graphics to show that.
6 - Create histograms of positions while performing multipsiblastcore. Keep the query position of each result and graphic it.
7 - Tree reconstruction.
8 - Show cores, following a species tree.
